<h3>Using the fitnesse standalone luncher</h3>
<br/>
<p>
	We first illustrated how to lunch fitnesse using the standalone version. You can use the FitnessStandaloneLuncher class and call it with
	two parameters which are the path where to find the standalone fitnesse jar and the port to use. Default values are provided as example.
	Since we are lunching it from a standalone version you can place the .jar anywhere that suits you. The ArithmeticServiceTest serves as a kind of proof of concept, or as a reference test. If you run it and it's green then you have everything set correctly.
